/**
 * Class to translate a JSQLParser statement into a relational algebra query plan. For now only
 * works for Statements that are Selects, and specifically PlainSelects. Could implement the visitor
 * pattern on the statement, but doesn't for simplicity as we do not handle nesting or other complex
 * query features.
 *
 * <p>Query plan fixes join order to the order found in the from clause and uses a left deep tree
 * join. Maximally pushes selections on individual relations and evaluates join conditions as early
 * as possible in the join tree. Projections (if any) are not pushed and evaluated in a single
 * projection operator after the last join. Finally, sorting and duplicate elimination are added if
 * needed.
 *
 * <p>For the subset of SQL which is supported as well as assumptions on semantics, see the Project
 * 2 student instructions, Section 2.1
